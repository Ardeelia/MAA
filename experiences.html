            <p>I studied at Allen Marathahalli in grade 11, taking JEE coaching. My experience was quite positive. The teachers were excellent and possessed 
                great subject expertise. They were also very patient when handling doubts and supportive and responsive overall. The peer group was also 
                amazing and possessed a healthy competitive spirit.</p>

            <p>The teachers are exactly opposite of what you would expect from a coaching centre. The entire emphasis (for the majority of my time there) was 
                put on learning the subjects thoroughly and clearing concepts rather than tricks on getting more marks. The teachers are experienced yet still 
                passionate about the subjects and their guidance is trustworthy. Overall an enjoyable journey.</p>

            <p>I'd like to say that my journey at Allen Marathahalli was extremely positive and there was a great emphasis on the learning and it felt 
                like the class interacted with each other a lot as well as with the teachers because they were driven by their curiosity. I think that 
                the teachers taught with a lot of passion and I would say generally I never felt like I wasn't enjoying the things which I was doing and 
                wasn't learning. I think the most valuable lesson imparted to me here was the lesson of how to enjoy learning even more so than how to learn.</p>

            <p>My JEE journey was a twisty ride and my mock marks were very inconsistent. The teachers guided me through most of it. Honestly, a lot 
                of the overarching planning was done by the teachers, with respect to what books to solve and how to approach problems. They brought 
                up interesting models and pre-loaded ideas that improve speed, sourcing questions from various countries sometimes. I enjoyed my time
                in Allen Marathalli and appreciate the knowledge I gained even outside my studies</p>

            <p>ALLEN Marathahalli provided me the platform for success. The course structure and study material targets to bring the best out of every student. 
                My JEE journey was with filled with highs and lows, but pushing forward through every low is my biggest takeaway from my preparation. 
                JEE tests more than just academics, the journey brings about discipline and learning how to tackle new situations. The process of learning 
                was very enjoyable and a lot of credit goes to the teachers and the way they have been teaching their subject with full enthusiasm. 
                Overall, the experience was very worth it, and will carry forward the learnings for future endeavors.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t easy. Got burnt out by the end of it. Obviously had my ups and downs throughout the 2 years. Just have to put your head down and 
                keep at it, enjoy the learning and work hard. Had my fair share of bad tests, I think they’re part of the prep. Just work hard and the 
                reward will be worth it :)</p>

            <p>Started off basic, but things got more interesting and advanced very quickly.
                I made sure to think from the perspective of a scientist inventing those things and understood the topic if I felt I could have 
                invented those things myself, understanding the thought process of the scientist.
                Some topics were annoying because much explanation was not given, so I couldn't understand it the way I like, but thats okay and you
                 need to learn to deal with that. Its also okay to memorize some things which you can't understand, or find it extremely difficult to reason. 
                 Some topics were too advanced so the syllabus only deals with a surface level understanding.
                I used to only look at my rank after the test results came out, and I'd often not bother to check where I went wrong in the test, which is
                 not a good thing. Even if I couldn't solve any questions in the test, it was important to make sure I see it's solutions and understand them 
                 at the end. Sometimes test giving is not the only way. Its okay to take a break from giving tests so you 
                 can focus on your study. If the tests 
                are too frequent and you end up being blank during the test, it wont help.</p>

            <p>My experience at Allen Marathahalli was amazing. The teachers used to give thought provoking questions which helped a lot in my jee journey. 
                I made many close friends and it was more fun than I thought it would be.</p>

            <p>I've had quite an interesting and great journey with allen marathahalli. I had first taken admission in a normal full day school and allen 
                evening batch. First few tests went well and teachers were quite encouraging and ready to solve doubts any time. Later, after the screening test, 
                we decided to shift to the morning batch. We met with campus head regarding this and the shift was done within two days. So, I went to
                 morning batch (initially srg b1 and later srg a1) and again teachers really motivated us in all aspects. Though difficulty level of tests was 
                 too high for some and too low for the rest, frequency of tests was pretty good and kept us all in good practice.</p>

            <p>I had a great experience at Allen Marathahalli.
                I really enjoyed my time learning new things there, most importantly because of the way a lot of things were taught which helped me gain better 
                insights. I'm really grateful to the teachers for their effort and constant support throughout my JEE journey which had a lot of ups and downs.</p>
